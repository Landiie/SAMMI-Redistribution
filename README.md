# SAMMI-Redistribution
A redistribution of the `2025.3.1` version of SAMMI and compatible components

This is not an official distribution. This is a redistribution, and it is your choice if you choose to grab 2025.3.1 from official sources, or from here. But in the event that 2025.3.1 disappears from official means of obtaining said version, this repository will be here.

It can be downloaded by going to the "releases" page of this repository.

After downloading and overwriting/installing files, turn off automatic updates from the settings to ensure you do not accidentally update.

## Why?

SAMMI is arguably one of the more approachable and capable stream assistants out there, and a lot of people want to use SAMMI.

Latest updates have been less than satisfactory, with constant pushes towards paid products that used to be free, and have been taking down entire streaming setups due to negligent changes:

such as `2026.2.0`, deleting everyone's installed extensions in the bridge, which i was [somehow speculated to have caused](https://i.imgur.com/xiQyPIQ.png) (this did [not end up being the case](https://i.imgur.com/g8rGCIV.png))?? This update also updated the bridge in a way that was entirely incorrect, giving an unminified version of the bridge users, as well as muddying up the SAMMI-Bridge repository (which i have preserved before this happened in [this repository](https://github.com/Landiie/SAMMI-Bridge), because i knew this would've been the case).

Or `2026.1.0`, haphazardly implementing version 2 of Twitch's Hype Train events, which, instead of renaming data recieved in SAMMI to ensure that data remained compatible with user's setups, was instead just provided as-is, requiring everyone using hype train triggers in SAMMI to [change around their data](https://i.imgur.com/HToEs52.png) for no real reason other than the developer simply choosing to not pay mind to it.

Safe to say, users are really worried about whatever update comes next for SAMMI and those either willing to keep using the app, or stuck using it, want to know what version is most stable. So that is why this repository exists. It is solely to redistribute a known-good copy of SAMMI that isn't riddled with poor decisions.
