This is in compliance with the licenses both SAMMI Core, and SAMMI Bridge are licensed under, Apache 2.0.

Changes are as follows:

- Removed "Deck Hopper Setup.exe" installation file located in "Deck Hopper" folder of release archive. This is to cut down on download size. You can still download Deck Hopper from other sources, but bear in mind it might only be updated for the latest version of SAMMI. Consider using an official alternative like SAMMI Panel.
- Added "Licenses" directory containing the same contents as the `Licenses` directory of this repository, in the release archive.
